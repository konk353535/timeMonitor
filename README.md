#timeMonitor
Will monitor league of legends players played time by every 4 hours accessing there match history and appending all played games to a local db. Can then pull from this db to generate stats such as. Time played today, last 7 days, last month, Rankings for users for most played X champ, rankings for users for most played in {server}, Badges ect ect. The possibilties are endless

The first step in development is to get a solid backend, that can add new users, can users every set period of time, add game information about the user to mongodb
